Simple hobby project to learn more about parsing stuff. It parses the MWSE documentation files. Currently a bit hacky and messy. Might be fixed in the future, but also might not be. Who knows.

Currently able to parse all the documentation asynchronously in ~150ms. I've yet to figure out how to write the documentation files asynchronously without a stupid amount of cloning, 
but I'm sure there's an elegant solution out there.
